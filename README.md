# ðŸ§  Modulation of Spontaneous Activity in Developing Sensory Cortices

This repository contains a spiking neural network model that investigates how inhibitory mechanisms modulate spontaneous activity patterns in the developing primary visual cortex (V1) of mouse pups. The project explores the role of distinct interneuron populationsâ€”parvalbumin-expressing (PV) and somatostatin-expressing (SST) cellsâ€”in shaping spatiotemporal properties of cortical activity during early postnatal development.

## ðŸ”¬ Abstract

During early sensory development, spontaneous neural activity helps refine synaptic connections before sensory input begins. In the V1 cortex, this activity arises from retinal and intrinsic cortical sources, producing low-synchrony L-events and high-synchrony H-events. Disruptions in this activity can lead to developmental disorders.

This project implements a spiking network model with one excitatory (E) population and two inhibitory populations (PV and SST interneurons) to simulate and analyze cortical dynamics. The model replicates experimental findings, including the effects of SST and PV modulation on event structure, and generates predictions relevant to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS).
